# 👋 About Me
Hi, I’m TimTimElim. Originally from Germany, I'm currently studying computer science (Ingeniørfag - Data) at the University of Agder in Norway.

# My Interests
I’m interested in learning code, project management, and work flows. In particular, I like how engineering projects encompass a whole idea.
This starts from a problem, to coming up with a solution, to implementing that solution. Of course, testing the solution to see if it produces the expected results is also a fun undertaking 👀
